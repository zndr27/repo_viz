## Background on DagsHub

DagsHub is a collaborative platform for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for versioning, sharing, and collaborating on data and machine learning projects. While DagsHub excels in managing data and workflows, we saw an opportunity to enhance its visualization capabilities for exploratory data analysis.

## Introducing RepoViz

Our new tool, RepoViz, allows you to effortlessly visualize data stored in your DagsHub repositories. Login with an access token, and youâ€™re ready to get started\!

## Instalation

The app uses D-Tale, SweetViz, and YData for exploratory data analysis.

## Usage

Once the app starts you'll be prompted to provide an access token.
